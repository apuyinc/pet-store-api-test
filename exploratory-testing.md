## Definition and priority
Regarding the definition of the exploratory testing and the priority of them, it all depends on the objective of the exploratory testing, if it is general bug finding, get familiar with the application, focusing on a regression for an specific feature, focus on the areas where the more bugs were found during development or even we do not have a test plan defined and we need an starting point for the test cases.

If it is one or another, the focus on corner cases or more end user happy paths.

But in general, my priority will be a combination of areas where more bugs are found during development and production and the more critical which I think is playing with expenses, incomes and main screen.


## Possible bugs found
Accountâ€™s initial balance is not being reflected in the chart
If user has expenses associated to multiple accounts, and all of the accounts are deleted, there is a remaining balance in the chart, even if all accounts were deleted.

## Improvements
In the transfer screen, the amount is the first field on screen, and then the origin and destination account.  The issue is that after fulfilling the amount, the transfer is saved and applied.  In other words, if the user wants to change the origin and destination account, has to do it before fulfilling the amount, being the amount the first field in the form.
Adding incomings or expenses for an account not being displayed on the main screen is not reflected on the chart and the user may seem this like a bug.  But for example, if the user adds an amount for the same account but different date, the main screen automatically switch to the selected date.
